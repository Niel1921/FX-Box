## Features

- **Real-Time Effects Processing**  
  Built with C++ on Bela for ultra-low latency audio FX and instant parameter changes.

- **Accessible Touch Control**  
  Touch strips (single and X/Y) make parameter control intuitive for users with a wide range of abilities, ideal for music therapy contexts.

- **Visual Feedback**  
  The OLED display provides clear, simple menus and live visualizers for each effect, helping users understand and engage with sound-shaping.

- **Multiple Effects Included**
  - **Delay** (X/Y control: delay time & feedback)
  - **Reverb** (X/Y control: reverb time & density)
  - **High/Low Pass Filter** (X/Y control: cutoff frequency & resonance)
  - **Tremolo** (X/Y control: rate & depth)
  - **Oscillator Mode** (for learning FX without external input)

- **Recording Functionality**  
  Record up to 15 seconds of processed audio with a single button press.

- **Easy Navigation**  
  Three buttons allow simple menu movement, mode selection, and operation.

- **Designed for Music Therapy and Learning**  
  Multi-sensory feedback (audio, visual, tactile) helps engage users, especially those with ASD or beginners in music tech.
